I have been tried many parental softwares and control at home and I choose [Switch On Safety DNS](https://switchonsafety.co.nz/)
which is great one and FREE. It can filter in seaching picture and video as well.

I believe this could help to enhance security at home and make internet cleaner for kid.

Stay connected, stay safe
