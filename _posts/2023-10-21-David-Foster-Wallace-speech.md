David Foster Wallace’s speech reminded us to aware of the default setting in our mind that will lead us to a difficult and unhappy in our daily life. As our mind is always wandering around and not so focus, so our mind can be easily shifted to unconscious mental operating mode in "day in day out". The author asked us to learn how to think and gain the power of choosing our thoughts and our reactions to lead our mindset to go to positive direction. Wallace mentioned "how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, respectable adult life dead, unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out.". If we pay attention to our default setting mind, we can avoid negative thoughts in our mind when we face the life’s challenges and build an intentional positive mindset that can give us more happiness and purposes in life.
