A cookie without the HttpOnly flag set can pose security risks. Let me explain:

**What is the HttpOnly flag?**
```The HttpOnly flag is an attribute set on a cookie that prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie’s value.
When the HttpOnly flag is set, browsers prevent scripts from reading or setting the cookie value, making it harder for attackers to exploit certain client-side attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).
```

**Why is the HttpOnly flag important?**
```
By setting the HttpOnly flag, sensitive information stored in cookies remains inaccessible to client-side scripts.
It mitigates the risk of attackers capturing cookie values via injected scripts.
Without this flag, cookies can be accessed by JavaScript, potentially exposing sensitive data.
```
**Consequences of not setting the HttpOnly flag:**

**Confidentiality Impact:** 
```If the HttpOnly flag is not set, sensitive information stored in the cookie may be exposed to unintended parties.```

**Integrity Impact:** 
```For authentication cookies, not setting the HttpOnly flag could allow an adversary to steal authentication data (e.g., a session ID) and assume the user’s identity.```

**Mitigation:**
```
**Implementation Phase:**
```
Leverage the HttpOnly flag when setting sensitive cookies in a response.
Note that while this mitigation is effective for protecting cookies from a browser’s own scripting engine, third-party components or plugins may have their own engines that allow access to cookies.```
```
