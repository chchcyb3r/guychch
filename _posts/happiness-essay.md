For this essay, I’d like you to think about happiness.  Below are a handful of idea-generating questions to answer to help you formulate some topics on which to write. 
You may choose to address any of these in your essay, or any other subjects related to happiness that you come up with. 
There is plenty more to discuss here that I have left unconsidered; happiness is a complex topic.

•	How do a person’s expectations play a role in how happy they are?
•	Is contentment a key to happiness? Why or why not? Explain.
•	Are you a happy person? If so…why? What makes you happy? And how so?
•	Are you not a happy person? If not…what do you think would make you happier?
•	Does happiness rely on outside stimuli? If so, what?
•	Is our happiness dependent upon how we view our surroundings and circumstances (our attitude), rather than the actual surroundings and circumstances themselves? Yes or no? And why?
•	What factors most influence your sense of happiness? (money, religion, hobbies, something else) How so?
•	How do other affect our happiness? (family, friends, pets, anyone else you’d care to discuss)
•	Cause and effect: Is happiness a bi-product of something else? If so…what?
•	Is there any everlasting, eternal feelings of happiness? If there is, what does/would bring eternal happiness? How?
•	If happiness isn’t everlasting, but rather temporary and fleeting, consider the duration of happiness. Maybe differentiate what leads to short-term happiness, versus long-term happiness?

## Happiness 
<br>

Happiness is a state of mind when people do not have any worries or distractions and it often brings satisfaction, and pleasures. This is really a multifaceted emotion that often dances beyond our grasp. Despite its fleeting nature, this sentiment is a center theme in people’s life, and they are chasing it in driving action and influencing perception of success and fulfillment. Understanding happiness requires more investigation further in the intricate of desires, pleasure, attitudes, satisfaction, and the external world. <br>

Most people consider happiness to come from parenthood which is always seen as the joyfulness of life, but it is revealing itself as a complex experience. While society frequently praises parenthood as a surefire path to happiness, research tells a different story. Studies prove that parents often have lower levels of happiness compared to non-parents, and that is challenging the conventional wisdom. As Daniel Gilbert mentioned this issue by noting "Our children give us many things, but an increase in our average daily happiness is probably not among them." in article "Does Fatherhood Make You Happy?" in Times. This statement shows that the reality of parenthood is so different, suggesting that its value transcends simple emotional metrics. Gilbert’s opinion highlights that happiness isn’t solely dependent on external circumstances like parenthood. Instead, it suggests that individuals have an inherent ability to create and maintain happiness, even amidst life’s challenges. Parenthood, while not a constant source of joy, offers deep opportunities for personal growth and fulfillment. Reflecting on personal experiences, it shows that joyfulness and meaningfulness are often found in life’s most demanding roles. Parenthood exemplifies this blend of highs and lows, illustrating the complex interplay between happiness and the inherent challenges of life. <br>

In an overwhelming world with messages about what people need, it is hard to find contentment in the present moments that can feel like a radical act of rebellion. In contrast to the ubiquitous notion that happiness always depends on external achievements and possessions, true satisfaction always begins from a deep sense of gratitude and inner contentment. The Dalai Lama, in his exploration of inner contentment, emphasizes the transformative power of gratitude in fostering a genuine sense of fulfillment. In his teachings, he highlights the importance of cultivating inner satisfaction as a path to happiness, “happiness is not something readymade. It comes from your own actions”, that highlights that true happiness is not dependent on external circumstances but instead a product of people's own mindset and actions. By cultivating gratitude and contentment with what people have, people can find lasting satisfaction. Research in positive psychology aligns with this view, highlighting the importance of gratitude in enhancing overall well-being. This reminds people that true happiness is not found in the pursuit of material possessions but in the appreciation of life’s essential beauty and richness. <br>

Happiness often comes with hidden costs, especially when it depends on the suffering of others. Ursula K. Le Guin’s 's “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas” clearly illustrates this by painting a idealistic society whose joy is rooted in the suffering of a single child. This narrative gives the opportunity to readers to confront the ethical complexities of happiness. Le Guin vividly describes this moral dilemma “The child used to scream for help at night, and cry a good deal, but now it only makes a kind of whining, "eh-haa, eh-haa," and it speaks less and less often. It is so thin there are no calves to its legs; its belly protrudes; it lives on a half-bowl of corn meal and grease a day. It is naked. Its buttocks and thighs are a mass of festered sores, as it sits in its own excrement continually.” This imagery compels readers to consider the moral implication of deriving happiness at the expense of another’s suffering. Le Guin's story is like a powerful allegory, questioning the true cost of happiness and exploring the interconnectedness of people's experiences. It challenges people to reflect on how their happiness might be linked to the suffering of others, prompting the individuals to consider the ethical dimensions of their actions and choices. “The Ones Who Walk From Omelas” encourages reflection on readers’ lives, urging people to examine how things around daily life such as global supply chains, environmental degradation, and social inequalities may intertwine their happiness with others’ suffering. In fact, the author directly compels readers to ponder whether their joy comes at the expense of others’ distress, urging a contemplation of the moral implications inherent in their decisions and conduct. It reminds individuals that genuine happiness cannot be achieved at the expense of other’s well-being and sometimes people forget about this. <br>

True happiness can only be found by stepping outside oneself and considering others first. David Foster Wallace mentioned in his famous speech “This is the Water”: “The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over,...” Mr. Wallace suggests that true happiness is not just about the absence of constrains but includes a deeper, more personal commitment to values such as attention, awareness, disciplined mind, and effort. Moreover, this disciplined method is proven to find happiness as Dalai Lama mentioned in his book "The Art of Happiness": “A disciplined mind leads to happiness. An undisciplined mind leads to suffering.” It’s all about the ability to care for others and make sacrifices, that can lead to a meaningful and fulfilling life. People need to control to let go of the greed of demanding more to find inner peace and outer effectiveness that are essential for happiness. When people choose to care more and sacrifice for others, they can find a deeper sense of satisfaction and joy transcends superficial pleasures. This kind of happiness is an active choice, prolonged effort, and discipline, but it is also deeply rewarding and integral to our well-being. <br>

I think most people expect to have happiness in their life and everyone is seeking happiness daily. They are always trying to achieve pleasure with satisfaction and true happiness. Pleasure with satisfaction is short-term happiness and true happiness is long-term happiness. People always seek pleasure and satisfaction more than they seek true happiness and they always misunderstand this sentiment is true happiness, but it is not. Pleasure with satisfaction is very easy to get and it lasts only for a short period of time and people will forget about it. It will not require individuals to change anything in their mind or to have any discipline for oneself or sacrifice for others, but people need keep chasing it every day to maintain the level of that happiness. It is like to keep running on a treadmill to maintain happiness and it needs a lot of external factors. However, true happiness does not require a lot of external things. People only need to look back to oneself to find their peace of mind and to remove the distraction in individual’s mind. This method is called mindfulness, and it requires individuals to keep practicing this with discipline for a long time until people can change their mind and it has become a default-setting in individual’s mind. In fact, I have practiced this method for over a year, and I am so happy to enjoy my life and live in each present moment. Even though I am on my journey to learn about mindfulness, and I am not a master at it. I am not sure it has become a default-setting in my mind yet, but I really enjoy my life and am so happy every day. I believe I achieve something, and I receive great results from my practice.  <br>

Happiness is really a complex topic to discuss, and it is the only things people demand to own it. In my opinion, happiness is a journey, it is not a destination. It is a personal quest, unique to each individual and I believe it s a universal language that will connect us all.
