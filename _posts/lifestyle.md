This kind of happiness is extrinsic motivation and is dependent on continuous achievement and recognition from others. This lifestyle can give happiness in a short time, but it will be like running on a treadmill to keep seeking more and more. In the other hand, inner contentment is a state of satisfaction and peace that come from within to enjoy what we currently have and stop demanding to have more. Both paths to happiness have their advantages and disadvantages. Inner contentment has its stability in the long run, and it is independent to external factors, but this lifestyle lacks excitement and luxury. “Rock Star” lifestyle give more luxury and pleasures, but it is unstable in long run, and it is dependence on the external motivation.
