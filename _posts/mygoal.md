My goal is to live a healthy lifestyle, which includes traveling and working remotely. I would like to change to a different setting so that I can try something different in the future after spending many year of doing the same thing every day at my previous workplace. In order to achieve the goal, I decided to take a vacation from my current career and attend college to learn new skills and to gain additional knowledge. Learning new skills requires me to work hard as same as going to work in my previous time. During the time in college, there are many challenges that encourage me and drive me to finish it. The workloads keep me busy but it also gives me a new broad of vision to see clearly about new career's goals and what I will do in the future. I am not sure what the future holds, but for now, I enjoy learning and make an effort to succeed in it.
